                  <li> C++ is one of the world's most popular programming languages. </li>
                  <li> It can be found in today's operating systems, Graphical User Interfaces, and embedded systems. </li>
                  <li> C++ is an object-oriented programming language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs.
                  C++ is fun and easy to learn! </li>
                  <li> Considering all this, ACES decided to organize a workshop on Basics of C++. It was a 2 days free workshop; open to all branches of PVG's COET.</li>             
                  <li> The workshop was arranged for 2 days (13th and 14th October 2022).</li>

                    It was a very interactive session. As they were being taught by their seniors, students could ask their doubts freely. <br>
                    The session provided the students something which could not be achieved through conventional classroom teaching. <br> 
                    After the session, students were confident and had a command over the language.
                    The session was very helpful for the students to clear their basics and gave a kickstart towards advanced coding.
