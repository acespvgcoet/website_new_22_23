                  <li> Python is one of the world's most popular programming languages. </li>
                  <li> Python is a popular general-purpose programming language. It is used in machine learning, web development, desktop applications, and many other fields.  </li>
                  <li> Considering all this, ACES decided to organize a workshop on Basics of Python. It was a 2 days free workshop; open to all branches of PVG's COET.</li>             
                  <li> The workshop was arranged for 2 days (28th and 29th January 2023).</li>

                    It was a very interactive session. As they were being taught by their seniors, students could ask their doubts freely. <br>
                    The session provided the students something which could not be achieved through conventional classroom teaching. <br> 
                    After the session, students were confident and had a command over the language.
                    The session was very helpful for the students to clear their basics and gave a kickstart towards advanced coding.
