                  <li> A blockchain is a distributed database or ledger shared among a computer network's nodes. </li>
                  <li>Blockchains can be used to make data in any industry immutableâ€”the term used to describe the inability to be altered. </li>
                  <li> A blockchain consists of programs called scripts that conduct the tasks you usually would in a database: Entering and accessing information and saving and storing it somewhere. </li>
                  <li>With many practical applications for the technology already being implemented and explored, blockchain is finally making a name for itself in no small part because of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency.</li>
                  <li> Considering all this, ACES decided to organize a workshop on Blockchain. It was a 1 day free workshop; open to all branches of PVG's COET.</li>             
                  <li> The workshop was arranged on (11th November 2022).</li>

                    It was a very interactive session. As they were being taught by their seniors, students could ask their doubts freely. <br>
                    The session provided the students something which could not be achieved through conventional classroom teaching. <br> 
                    The session was intresting and the students were enthusiastic and interactive as Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies being one of the hot topics lately.
                    The session was very helpful for the students to understand about Blockchain and its other branches.
